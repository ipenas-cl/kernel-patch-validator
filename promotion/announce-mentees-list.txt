Subject: [ANNOUNCE] kernel-patch-validator - Tool to validate patches before submission

Hi everyone,

After getting patches rejected multiple times for common mistakes, I built
a tool to validate patches before submission. It catches issues that
frequently lead to rejections.

Features:
- 21+ automated checks based on real maintainer feedback
- Validates format, DCO, changelog placement, dates
- Integrated checkpatch.pl with enhanced reporting
- Tools to find first contributions (find-bugs.sh)
- Patch series validation

Available at: https://github.com/ipenas-cl/kernel-patch-validator

Quick usage:
$ git format-patch -1
$ validate-patch.sh 0001-your-patch.patch

Example issues it catches:
- Future dates (2025 bug from wrong system clock)
- Missing changelog in v2+ patches after --- marker  
- Multiple logical changes in one patch
- Wrong Signed-off-by format

The tool includes additional scripts:
- find-bugs.sh: Finds spelling errors, checkpatch issues
- test-patch.sh: Safe testing workflow
- contribution-checklist.sh: Readiness assessment

Each check is based on actual rejection feedback. Hope this helps other
newcomers avoid the same mistakes.

Feedback and contributions welcome!

Thanks,
Ignacio Pe√±a
