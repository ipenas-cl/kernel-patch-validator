Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Tool to help validate staging driver patches

Hi staging contributors,

Since staging is where many of us start contributing to the kernel, I built
a tool that validates patches before submission. It catches common mistakes
that lead to immediate rejections.

The tool performs 21+ checks including:
- Proper changelog placement for v2+ patches  
- checkpatch.pl --strict compliance (important for staging!)
- Single logical change validation
- Date validation (catches the 2025 bug)
- DCO and format compliance

Also includes find-bugs.sh which helps locate first contributions:
- Spelling/grammar errors in comments
- checkpatch issues in staging drivers
- Missing SPDX identifiers

Available at: https://github.com/ipenas-cl/kernel-patch-validator

Example usage:
$ git format-patch -1
$ ./validate-patch.sh 0001-staging-rtl8723bs-fix-checkpatch.patch

This would have saved me from several rejections when I started
contributing to staging drivers.

Thanks,
Ignacio Pe√±a
