sudo make install
```

## Phase 3: First Contributions (Weeks 4-12)

### Easy Entry Points

**1. Spelling and Grammar Fixes**:
```bash
# Find spelling errors in kernel messages
grep -r "teh\|hte\|adn\|nad\|recieve\|occured" . --include="*.c" | head -10

# Check documentation typos
find Documentation/ -name "*.rst" -exec aspell check {} \;

# Create your first patch
git format-patch -1 --subject-prefix="PATCH"
```

**2. Static Analysis Fixes**:
```bash
# Run sparse on the entire kernel
make C=2 2>&1 | tee sparse-output.txt

# Focus on specific areas
make C=1 drivers/staging/ 2>&1 | tee sparse-staging.txt

# Run smatch for deeper analysis
make CHECK="smatch -p=kernel" C=1 drivers/staging/

# Fix warnings one by one
# Start with obvious ones like:
# - Uninitialized variables
# - Missing annotations (__user, __iomem)
# - Endianness issues
```

**3. .gitignore File Updates**:
```bash
# Build tools and check for untracked files
make -C tools/
git status | grep "Untracked files"

# Add missing .gitignore entries
echo "tool_binary" >> tools/your_tool/.gitignore

# Build selftests
make -C tools/testing/selftests/
git status

# Add .gitignore for test binaries
echo "test_program" >> tools/testing/selftests/your_test/.gitignore
```

**4. Syzbot Bug Reports**:
```bash
# Monitor syzbot reports
# https://syzkaller.appspot.com/

# Look for recent reports with reproducers
# Download the reproducer
wget https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=12345.c

# Try to reproduce the bug
gcc -o reproducer reproducer.c
./reproducer

# Analyze the crash report
# Use our decode_stacktrace.sh guide
# Study the code path leading to the crash
```

### Contribution Workflow

**Standard Process**:
```bash
# 1. Create working branch
git checkout -b fix-spelling-errors

# 2. Make your changes
vim drivers/staging/some_driver/file.c

# 3. Test thoroughly
./scripts/test-patch.sh 0001-your-patch.patch

# 4. Validate the patch
./scripts/validate-patch.sh 0001-your-patch.patch

# 5. Find maintainers
./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-your-patch.patch

# 6. Send the patch
git send-email --to="maintainer@example.com" 0001-your-patch.patch
```
