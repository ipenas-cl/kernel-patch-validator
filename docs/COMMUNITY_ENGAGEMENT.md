# Community Engagement and Diversity Guidelines

*Inspired by LKMP's mission to increase diversity in the Linux kernel community*

## Building an Inclusive Kernel Community

### LKMP Diversity Mission
The Linux Kernel Mentorship Program specifically aims to "increase diversity in the Linux Kernel community and work towards making the kernel more secure and sustainable." This reflects the understanding that diverse perspectives lead to better software and stronger communities.

### Creating Welcoming Environments

#### For Experienced Contributors
```
When reviewing patches from newcomers:

DO:
✓ Provide specific, actionable feedback
✓ Explain the "why" behind requests, not just "what"
✓ Point to documentation and examples
✓ Acknowledge good practices when you see them
✓ Be patient with learning curves
✓ Remember everyone was a beginner once

Example good review:
"The locking here looks incorrect. You need to hold the mutex 
before accessing shared_data. See drivers/net/example.c:123 
for the proper pattern. Also, great job on the error handling 
in the rest of this function!"

DON'T:
✗ Use dismissive language ("obviously", "clearly", "just")
✗ Make assumptions about background knowledge
✗ Leave feedback without explanation
✗ Focus only on what's wrong
✗ Use aggressive or condescending tone

Example poor review:
"This is all wrong. You clearly don't understand locking."
```

#### For New Contributors
```
When entering the community:

DO:
✓ Read documentation and search archives first
✓ Ask specific questions with context
✓ Thank reviewers for their time
✓ Learn from feedback without taking it personally
✓ Help other newcomers when you can
✓ Share your learning journey through blogs/talks

DON'T:
✗ Expect immediate responses
✗ Take technical criticism personally
✗ Demand exceptions to established processes
✗ Complain about the learning curve
✗ Give up after first patch rejection
```

### Supporting Underrepresented Groups

#### Mentorship and Sponsorship
```
As you grow in the community:

MENTORSHIP (teaching skills):
- Review patches from newer contributors
- Answer questions on mailing lists and IRC
- Write documentation and tutorials
- Give talks about your experience
- Share debugging techniques and workflows

SPONSORSHIP (opening doors):
- Recommend qualified people for opportunities
- Include diverse voices in technical discussions
- Invite newcomers to participate in meetings
- Suggest speakers from underrepresented groups
- Amplify good work done by others

Example sponsorship:
"[Name] has been doing excellent work on staging driver 
cleanup. Their recent patch series for rtl8723bs was 
particularly well-done. They might be a good candidate 
for [opportunity]."
```

#### Creating Safe Spaces
```
In technical discussions:

INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE:
✓ "This approach has a problem..."
✓ "The code could be improved by..."
✓ "Have you considered..."
✓ "One alternative would be..."

EXCLUSIVE LANGUAGE:
✗ "Your code is broken"
✗ "You don't understand X"
✗ "Obviously you should..."
✗ "Anyone knows that..."

WELCOMING BEHAVIORS:
✓ Credit contributors appropriately
✓ Explain acronyms and jargon
✓ Provide context for decisions
✓ Celebrate first contributions
✓ Acknowledge different learning styles
```

## Professional Communication Standards

### Code of Conduct Awareness
The Linux kernel community follows the [Linux Kernel Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html).

#### Key Principles
```
1. RESPECT: Treat all community members with respect
2. PROFESSIONALISM: Focus on technical merit
3. INCLUSIVITY: Welcome contributors from all backgrounds
4. CONSTRUCTIVENESS: Provide helpful, actionable feedback
5. COLLABORATION: Work together toward common goals
```

### Handling Conflicts

#### De-escalation Techniques
```
When discussions become heated:

1. PAUSE: Take time before responding emotionally
2. FOCUS: Return discussion to technical merits
3. ACKNOWLEDGE: Recognize valid points from all sides
4. CLARIFY: Ask questions to understand concerns
5. DOCUMENT: Keep records of decisions and reasoning

Example de-escalation:
"I think we're getting off track. Let me clarify the 
technical requirement: we need X because of Y constraint. 
The two approaches on the table are A and B. Can we 
evaluate each based on performance and maintainability?"
```

#### When to Escalate
```
Contact maintainers or moderators when:
- Personal attacks occur
- Harassment is reported
- Technical discussion becomes abusive
- Someone violates the code of conduct
- You feel unsafe participating

How to escalate:
1. Document the problematic behavior
2. Contact appropriate maintainer privately
3. Provide context and evidence
4. Focus on behavior, not personalities
5. Suggest constructive solutions
```

## Building Long-term Community Health

### Sustainable Contribution Practices

#### Avoiding Burnout
```
For yourself:
- Set realistic goals and expectations
- Take breaks from intensive work periods
- Celebrate small wins and progress
- Build support networks within the community
- Maintain work-life balance
- Ask for help when overwhelmed

For others:
- Don't expect immediate responses to reviews
- Respect time zones and personal schedules
- Offer specific help rather than vague "let me know"
- Share workload in collaborative projects
- Check in on contributors who seem stressed
```

#### Knowledge Transfer
```
Document and share:
- Debugging techniques that work
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Useful tools and configurations
- Process knowledge and unwritten rules
- Historical context for design decisions

Create learning resources:
- Write blog posts about your journey
- Give talks at conferences
- Contribute to documentation
- Record debugging sessions for others
- Create examples and tutorials
```

### Fostering Innovation

#### Encouraging Experimentation
```
Support new ideas by:
- Providing safe spaces to try approaches
- Offering constructive feedback on RFC patches
- Helping newcomers navigate review processes
- Connecting people with relevant expertise
- Celebrating creative solutions

Create opportunities:
- Suggest projects suitable for different skill levels
- Connect newcomers with appropriate mentors
- Identify areas where fresh perspectives help
- Encourage participation in design discussions
- Support conference presentations by new contributors
```

#### Balancing Stability and Progress
```
In technical discussions:
- Explain the reasoning behind conservative approaches
- Help newcomers understand backward compatibility needs
- Show how to propose changes that minimize risk
- Teach the importance of testing and validation
- Demonstrate how to gather community consensus

Example explanation:
"The kernel needs to maintain ABI compatibility, so we can't 
change this interface. However, we could add a new function 
that provides the behavior you want while keeping the old 
one for existing users."
```

## Recognition and Attribution

### Proper Credit Practices
```
Always acknowledge contributions:

IN COMMIT MESSAGES:
Co-Authored-By: Contributor Name <email@example.com>
Suggested-by: Reviewer Name <email@example.com>
Reported-by: Bug Reporter <email@example.com>
Tested-by: Tester Name <email@example.com>

IN DISCUSSIONS:
"As [Name] pointed out in their earlier message..."
"Building on [Name]'s suggestion..."
"Thanks to [Name] for identifying this issue..."

IN PRESENTATIONS:
- Credit collaborators in slides
- Mention reviewers who improved the work
- Acknowledge mentors and supporters
- Include contributors from entire development process
```

### Amplifying Voices
```
Use your platform to:
- Retweet/share good work by underrepresented contributors
- Recommend diverse speakers for conferences
- Include different perspectives in technical discussions
- Cite work by people from various backgrounds
- Create opportunities for others to be heard

Example amplification:
"Really excellent analysis by [Name] of the locking 
issues in [subsystem]. Worth reading: [link]"
```

## Community Growth Strategies
