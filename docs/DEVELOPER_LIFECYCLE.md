# Open Source Developer Lifecycle and Career Paths

*Understanding the journey from newcomer to maintainer in the Linux kernel community*

## The Developer Journey

### Overview of Developer Stages

The evolution of an open source developer follows predictable patterns, though individuals may progress at different rates and take different paths:

```
Window Shopper → Silent Observer → New Contributor → User/Tester
                                         ↓
Active Contributor ← Expert Contributor ← Specialist Contributor
        ↓
   Maintainer (optional)
```

**Key Insight**: You can play multiple roles simultaneously. You might be an expert in one area while being a newcomer in another, or maintain one subsystem while actively learning about others.

### Stage 1: Window Shopper

**Characteristics**:
- Curious about open source but not yet committed
- Browsing code occasionally without deep engagement
- May follow mailing lists or GitHub repositories passively
- Uncertain about how to contribute meaningfully

**How to Progress**:
```bash
# Start exploring the codebase
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
find . -name "*.c" | head -10 | xargs wc -l

# Subscribe to mailing lists (lurk mode)
# linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
# linux-kernel-mentees@lists.linuxfoundation.org

# Read recent discussions
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/

# Explore areas of interest
ls drivers/    # Device drivers
ls net/        # Networking stack
ls fs/         # Filesystems
ls mm/         # Memory management
```

**Timeline**: Days to weeks

### Stage 2: Silent Observer

**Characteristics**:
- Regularly following development discussions
- Understanding community dynamics and communication patterns
- Learning terminology and conventions
- Building knowledge without participating directly

**Activities**:
```bash
# Study patch submissions
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | head -20

# Analyze commit messages
git show --stat HEAD~10..HEAD

# Learn from code reviews
# Follow patch discussions on LKML
# Study rejection reasons and fixes

# Understand subsystem structure
./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --scm
cat MAINTAINERS | head -50
```

**Key Learning Areas**:
- Patch submission process
- Code review culture
- Technical discussions and decision-making
- Community etiquette and communication styles

**Timeline**: Weeks to months

### Stage 3: New Contributor

**Characteristics**:
- Making first attempts at contribution
- Learning by doing with guidance
- Building confidence through small successes
- Developing technical and social skills

**First Contribution Strategies**:

**Option A: Documentation (Lowest barrier)**
```bash
# Fix typos and improve clarity
grep -r "teh\|hte\|adn\|nad" Documentation/
# Fix obvious typos

# Improve examples
find Documentation/ -name "*.rst" -exec grep -l "example" {} \;
# Add missing examples or clarify existing ones
```

**Option B: Staging Driver Cleanup**
```bash
# Find staging drivers needing work
ls drivers/staging/
cat drivers/staging/*/TODO

# Run checkpatch on staging drivers
./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/*.c
# Fix warnings and errors

# Simple cleanups
# - Remove unnecessary typedefs
# - Fix spacing and alignment
# - Remove dead code
```

**Option C: Testing and Bug Reports**
```bash
# Test latest kernels
git checkout v6.1-rc1
make defconfig && make -j$(nproc)
# Install and test, report any regressions

# Provide detailed bug reports
# Include environment, steps to reproduce
# Offer to test patches
```

**First Patch Checklist**:
- [ ] Understand the problem you're solving
- [ ] Follow existing code style exactly
- [ ] Test thoroughly (compile + functional)
- [ ] Write clear commit message explaining WHY
- [ ] Use get_maintainer.pl for recipients
- [ ] Send to correct mailing list
- [ ] Respond professionally to feedback

**Timeline**: Months

### Stage 4: User/Tester

**Characteristics**:
- Actively using and testing kernel developments
- Providing valuable feedback from real-world usage
- Catching bugs that developers miss
- Building reputation for thorough testing

**Testing Contributions**:
```bash
# Regular testing of development kernels
git remote add linux-next https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
git fetch linux-next
git checkout linux-next/master

# Run comprehensive tests
make allmodconfig && make -j$(nproc)
# Boot test, functional test, stress test

# Report issues with detailed information
# Hardware configuration
# Kernel config
# Steps to reproduce
# Bisection results if possible
```

**Value to Community**:
- Finding integration issues early

**Timeline**: Ongoing (can be concurrent with other stages)

### Stage 5: Active Contributor

**Characteristics**:
- Regular, meaningful contributions to the kernel
- Known by subsystem maintainers
- Helping to review other contributors' patches
- Taking on larger, more complex tasks

**Contribution Areas**:

**Bug Fixing**:
```bash
# Monitor bug reports
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/
# Pick bugs in your area of interest

# Use git bisect for regressions
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v6.0
# Follow bisection process
```

**Feature Development**:
```bash
# Implement new features

## Paths to Maintainership

### Path 1: New Driver Development

**Strategy**: Write a completely new driver for hardware not yet supported.

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Identify unsupported hardware
lspci | grep -i "unknown\|generic"
lsusb | grep -v "hub"

# 2. Research hardware specifications
# Obtain datasheets and programming manuals
# Study similar existing drivers

# 3. Develop the driver
# Start with basic functionality
# Add features incrementally
# Follow subsystem conventions

# 4. Submit for inclusion
# Get driver reviewed and merged
# Become the natural maintainer
```

**Timeline**: 6 months to 2 years

### Path 2: Adopt Orphaned Subsystem

**Strategy**: Take over maintenance of unmaintained code.

**Identification**:
```bash
# Find orphaned subsystems
grep -i "orphan\|unmaintained" MAINTAINERS

# Check maintenance activity
git log --since="1 year ago" --oneline drivers/staging/obsolete/ | wc -l

# Look for maintainer stepping down announcements
# Monitor LKML for transition opportunities
```

**Process**:
1. Demonstrate expertise in the area
2. Show commitment through consistent contributions
3. Gain community support
4. Formally request maintainership
5. Work with existing maintainer (if any) for transition

**Timeline**: 1-3 years

### Path 3: Staging Driver Graduation

**Strategy**: Clean up and graduate staging drivers to mainline.

**Process**:
```bash
# 1. Choose a staging driver
ls drivers/staging/
cat drivers/staging/*/TODO

# 2. Understand the cleanup requirements
# Fix checkpatch warnings
# Remove unnecessary abstractions
# Improve error handling
# Add proper device tree support

# 3. Work with staging maintainers
# Submit incremental improvements
# Address all TODO items
# Pass review for mainline inclusion

# 4. Become maintainer of graduated driver
```

**Timeline**: 6 months to 2 years

### Path 4: Expert Specialization

**Strategy**: Become the go-to expert in a specific technical area.

**Development Process**:
```bash
# 1. Choose specialization area
# Memory management
# Network protocols
# Filesystem internals
# Device drivers (specific type)
# Security subsystems

# 2. Deep technical contributions
# Fix complex bugs
# Implement performance improvements
# Add new features
# Write comprehensive documentation

# 3. Build community recognition
# Speak at conferences
# Write technical articles
# Review patches in your area
# Mentor others

# 4. Natural progression to maintainership
# When current maintainer steps down
# When subsystem needs additional maintainers
# When creating new subsystem
```

**Timeline**: 2-5 years

### Path 5: Feature Leadership

**Strategy**: Lead development of major new kernel features.

**Examples**:
- Container technologies (namespaces, cgroups)
- Security frameworks (LSM, KASAN)
- Performance features (eBPF, io_uring)
- Hardware support (new CPU architectures)

**Process**:
1. Identify important missing capability
2. Build consensus around solution approach
3. Implement proof-of-concept
4. Lead collaborative development
5. Coordinate integration across subsystems
6. Natural maintainership of new infrastructure

**Timeline**: 2-4 years
