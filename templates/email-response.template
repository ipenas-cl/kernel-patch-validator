Your specific technical response here. Be concise and direct.
Address the exact concern raised.

If the reviewer is correct:
"You're absolutely right. I'll fix this in v2."

If you need clarification:
"Could you clarify what you mean by X? I want to make sure I 
understand the concern correctly."

If providing additional context:
"This approach was chosen because of Y constraint. However, 
if you prefer approach Z, I can change it."

> Another specific point from the reviewer?

Another focused response. Examples:

For technical corrections:
"Good catch! The locking is indeed wrong. I'll use mutex_lock() 
instead as you suggested."

For design feedback:
"I see your point about the API design. The alternative would be
to use X approach, which would simplify the caller code. Let me
know if you prefer that direction."

For testing questions:
"I tested this on x86_64 with CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y and ran the
stress test for 24 hours without issues. Should I test on other
architectures as well?"

> Any requests for changes?

Will fix in v2. Timeline: I'll submit v2 tomorrow after addressing
all the feedback. [Or explain why the current approach is correct
with technical reasoning]

Thanks for the detailed review! Your feedback helps improve the code.

EXAMPLE GOOD RESPONSES:

1. When you made a mistake:
"You're absolutely right about the memory leak. I missed the 
error path cleanup. Will fix in v2."

2. When asking for clarification:
"I'm not sure I understand the concern about performance.
Could you elaborate on which specific path you think is 
problematic?"

3. When proposing alternatives:
"I see the issue with the current approach. Would it be 
better to use the existing helper function X instead of 
rolling our own?"

4. When providing test results:
"I tested this change with:
- CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y on x86_64
- Stress test for 48 hours
- All subsystem regression tests pass
- No new warnings in dmesg"
