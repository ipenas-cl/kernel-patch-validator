You're absolutely right - the irony of a date validation tool having a 
date bug! Already fixed to check for dates > current year.

Thank you for testing and opening the issues. I'm working through them:
- Fixed the 2025 check (now validates against current date)
- Fixed the `set -e` issue causing early exit
- Updated stable email validation to accept stable@kernel.org
- Will remove remaining emojis as suggested

Agreed completely. I see two paths forward:

1. Port the most valuable checks to checkpatch.pl (changelog placement,
   date validation, series consistency)
2. Keep complex workflow tools separate (find-bugs.sh, test-patch.sh)

Would you prefer patches adding individual checks to checkpatch.pl, or
should I create an RFC with a broader set of additions first?

The validator helped me understand common mistakes through experimentation.
Now that the patterns are clear, integrating into checkpatch.pl makes
perfect sense.

Thanks,
Ignacio
