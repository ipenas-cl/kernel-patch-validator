# Alternative Promotion Strategies for kernel-patch-validator

Since kernelnewbies IRC is dead, here are effective ways to promote the tool:

## 1. Official Kernel Documentation (Primary Strategy)
- **Status**: Patch created for Documentation/dev-tools/
- **Benefits**: Official recognition, high visibility
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for review/merge

## 2. Kernel Mailing Lists

### linux-kernel-mentees@lists.linuxfoundation.org
- Perfect audience (new contributors)
- Send announcement with examples
- Subject: [ANNOUNCE] patch-validator: Tool to validate patches before submission

### kernelnewbies@kernelnewbies.org
- Still active mailing list (even if IRC is dead)
- Many beginners subscribe here

### Subsystem-specific lists
- linux-staging@lists.linux.dev (great for new contributors)
- workflows@vger.kernel.org (tools and workflows)

## 3. Social Media and Forums

### Reddit
- r/kernel - Linux kernel development
- r/linux - General Linux community
- Post: "I built a tool to validate kernel patches after getting rejected multiple times"

### Mastodon/Twitter
- Tag #LinuxKernel #KernelDevelopment
- Mention @gregkh (he often shares useful tools)

### LinkedIn
- Linux Kernel Developers group
- Open Source Software group

## 4. Direct Integration

### Kernel CI systems
- Contact kernelci.org about integration
- Could run validator on submitted patches

### 0-day bot enhancement
- Suggest to Intel 0-day team
- Could add validator checks

## 5. Conference Presentations

### Linux Plumbers Conference
- Submit "Testing & Tools" track talk
- Title: "Reducing kernel patch rejections with automated validation"

### FOSDEM
- Submit to "Kernel" devroom
- Focus on helping new contributors

### Kernel Recipes
- European kernel conference
- Good for tool demonstrations

## 6. Content Marketing

### LWN.net article
Write article for LWN:
- "A tool for validating kernel patches"
- Include statistics on common rejections
- Show before/after examples

### Blog posts
- kernelnewbies.org blog
- Personal technical blog
- dev.to / Medium with #linux tag

## 7. Package Distribution

### Debian/Ubuntu
- Create .deb package
- Submit to Debian mentors

### Fedora/RHEL
- Create RPM package  
- Submit to Fedora

### AUR (Arch Linux)
- Create PKGBUILD
- Quick adoption by Arch users

## 8. Integration with Existing Tools

### git-series enhancement
- Contact git-series maintainer
- Suggest integration

### b4 tool integration
- Contact Konstantin Ryabitsev
- b4 could call validator

## 9. University Outreach

### Operating Systems courses
- Contact professors teaching OS
- Great for student first patches

### GSoC/Outreachy
- Promote to mentees
- Include in mentor materials

## 10. Direct Outreach

### Email kernel maintainers
Target friendly maintainers:

## Sample Announcement Email

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] kernel-patch-validator - Automated patch validation tool

Hi everyone,

After getting patches rejected multiple times for common mistakes, I built
a tool to validate patches before submission. It catches issues that
frequently lead to rejections.

Features:
- 21+ automated checks based on real maintainer feedback
- Validates format, DCO, changelog placement, dates
- Integrated checkpatch.pl with enhanced reporting  
- Tools to find first contributions
- Patch series validation

Available at: https://github.com/ipenas-cl/kernel-patch-validator

Quick usage:
$ git format-patch -1
$ validate-patch.sh 0001-your-patch.patch

The tool has already helped several new contributors get their first
patches accepted.

Feedback and contributions welcome!

Thanks,
Ignacio Pe√±a
```
