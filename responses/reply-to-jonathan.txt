Good question. I kept it external for several reasons:

1. Rapid iteration - As a new contributor, I'm still learning what checks
   are valuable. External development lets me update quickly based on
   feedback.

2. Bash implementation - The scripts are in bash for simplicity, which
   might not be ideal for kernel scripts/ directory.

3. Overlaps with checkpatch.pl - As Greg KH suggested, many checks should
   eventually go into checkpatch.pl rather than a separate tool.

My current plan based on feedback:
- Port the most valuable checks to checkpatch.pl (working on patches)
- Keep workflow tools (find-bugs.sh, test-patch.sh) as external helpers
- Maintain the external tool for experimental checks and rapid updates

Would you prefer I withdraw this documentation patch until the checkpatch.pl
integration is done, or would documenting the external tool still be valuable
for new contributors in the meantime?

Thanks,
