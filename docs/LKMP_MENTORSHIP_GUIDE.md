## Mentorship Best Practices

### Communication Guidelines

#### With Mentors
```
Weekly Check-ins:
- Prepare agenda in advance
- Document blockers and progress
- Ask specific technical questions
- Share code and patches for review

Email Etiquette:
- Use clear, descriptive subject lines
- Include relevant context
- Attach patches inline, not as files
- Respond promptly to feedback

IRC/Forum Participation:
- Be respectful and professional
- Search archives before asking questions
- Contribute to discussions constructively
- Help other mentees when possible
```

#### With Community
```
Mailing List Interactions:
- Follow LKML posting guidelines
- Use proper patch submission format
- Respond to reviewer feedback constructively
- Thank reviewers for their time

Code Review Process:
- Submit early, iterate often
- Test thoroughly before submission
- Document testing performed
- Be open to criticism and suggestions
```

### Technical Development

#### Week 1-2: Environment Setup
```bash
# Complete development environment
./scripts/checkpatch.pl --help
./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --help
git config --global sendemail.confirm auto

# First simple contributions
grep -r "TODO" drivers/staging/
./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict drivers/staging/*/
```

#### Week 3-6: Core Learning
```bash
# Study subsystem architecture
cd drivers/your-subsystem/
grep -r "EXPORT_SYMBOL" .
find . -name "*.h" -exec grep -l "struct" {} \;

# Make meaningful contributions
git format-patch -1 --subject-prefix="PATCH"
./scripts/get_maintainer.pl your-patch.patch
git send-email your-patch.patch
```

#### Week 7-12: Advanced Work
```bash
# Tackle complex issues
make C=1 drivers/your-area/
make CHECK="smatch -p=kernel" C=1 drivers/your-area/

# Performance analysis
perf record -g make drivers/your-area/
perf report

# Security analysis
./scripts/coccinelle/ --dir drivers/your-area/
```

### Common Mentee Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Debugging Complexity
**Problem**: Kernel debugging is overwhelming for beginners

**Solution**:
```bash
# Start with simple tools
echo "debug info" > /dev/kmsg
dmesg | tail -20

# Use available debug infrastructure
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/verbose
echo 'file drivers/your-driver.c +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

# Build with debug symbols
make CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
```

#### Challenge 2: Patch Submission Process
**Problem**: Understanding proper patch format and process

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use our validator
./scripts/validate-patch.sh your-patch.patch

# Follow the checklist
./scripts/pre-send-checklist.sh

# Study good examples
git log --oneline --grep="staging" | head -10
git show <commit-hash>
```

#### Challenge 3: Code Review Feedback
**Problem**: Receiving and acting on technical criticism

**Solution**:
```
Response Template:
"Thank you for the detailed review. You're absolutely right about 
[specific point]. I'll address this in v2 by [specific action]."

Learning Approach:
1. Don't take feedback personally
2. Ask for clarification when needed
3. Research suggested alternatives
4. Test thoroughly before resubmitting
```

## Mentee Success Stories

### Key Learnings from Alumni
1. **Start Small** - Begin with documentation and simple fixes
2. **Be Persistent** - Kernel development has a steep learning curve
3. **Engage Community** - Active participation accelerates learning
4. **Document Everything** - Keep detailed notes of debugging processes
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Quality over quantity in contributions

### Common Success Patterns
```
Month 1: Environment setup, first documentation patch
Month 2: Simple staging driver cleanups
Month 3: First real bug fix with testing
Month 4+: Meaningful feature contributions
```

Remember: The goal is not just to complete the mentorship, but to become a long-term contributor to the kernel community. Focus on learning, building relationships, and developing sustainable contribution habits.
