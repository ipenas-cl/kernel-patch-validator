Fixed in commit 453205e

Thank you for testing and reporting these issues! All have been addressed:

- Date validation now checks against current year 
- Removed 'set -e' to show all validation errors
- Both stable@kernel.org and stable@vger.kernel.org are now accepted
- All emojis removed from scripts

I'm also working on your suggestion to integrate checks into checkpatch.pl directly.
